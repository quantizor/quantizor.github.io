# hey there

My goal is to be your **ideal technical execution partner**. Bring your designs and ideas, and I will help manifest them into reality.

Throughout my career, I've bridged the gap between worlds. I can strategize with the executives, crit with the designers, code with the engineers, and I pick up new skills all the time. I also have plenty of [references](https://www.linkedin.com/in/probablyup).

Perfection is in the care you impart into a product; I treat product engineering like **_artisanry in digital form_**.

At my core I enjoy growing things. Often times it's software, sometimes it's plants, sometimes it's ideas. That's what being a _developer_ is to me: to curate raw materials and harness them to make something useful and, ideally, beautiful.

[Book a call](https://calendly.com/evanjacobs/15min), let's build something great together.

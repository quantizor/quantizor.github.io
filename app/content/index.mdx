# hey there

I enjoy building delightful products. It feels like a form of art to me: to take a concept, shape it, _mold it_.

Perfection is in the care you impart into a product. Do you pick it up, play with it, stress test it, inspect it, and massage it to make it the best thing it can be?

***Artisanry in digital form.***

At my core I enjoy growing things. Often times it's code, sometimes it's plants, sometimes it's ideas. That's what being a _developer_ is to me: to see raw materials and wield them to make something useful and, ideally, beautiful.

If you read all that and are interested, you should reach out. I'm happy to chat about any project. I charge $150 an hour (normalized to 40 hour work weeks) in two-week sprints. We will agree on a scope of work and I will deliver it to you in the quoted timeframe matching your specs beautifully and in a form that isn't throwaway and can be interated on for a long time if you wish.

Sound good? Looking forward to hearing from you.

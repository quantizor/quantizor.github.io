# hey there

My goal is to be your **ideal technical execution partner**. Bring your designs and ideas, and I will help manifest them into reality.

Throughout my career, I've bridged the gap between worlds. I can strategize with the executives, crit with the designers, code with the engineers, and I pick up new skills all the time. I also have plenty of [references](https://www.linkedin.com/in/probablyup/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

Perfection is in the care you impart into a product; I treat product engineering like ***artisanry in digital form***.

At my core I enjoy growing things. Often times it's software, sometimes it's plants, sometimes it's ideas. That's what being a _developer_ is to me: to curate raw materials and harness them to make something useful and, ideally, beautiful.

{/* If you read all that and are interested, you should reach out. I'm happy to chat about any project. I charge [rate] an hour (normalized to 40 hour work weeks) in two-week sprints. We will agree on a scope of work and I will deliver it to you in the quoted timeframe matching your specs beautifully and in a form that isn't throwaway and can be interated on for a long time if you wish.

Sound good? Looking forward to hearing from you. */}

[Book a call](https://calendly.com/evanjacobs/15min), let's build something great together.
